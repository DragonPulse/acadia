/**
 *
 * see https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water
 * and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are
 * all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * 11110
 * 11010
 * 11000
 * 00000
 * Answer: 1
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00100
 * 00011
 * Answer: 3
